    {"rating": 4, "text": "Applied to 12 companies in one afternoon. The one-click apply with stored resume profiles saved me hours of repetitive form filling.", "is_featured": False},
    {"rating": 2, "text": "The platform has potential but some job listings felt outdated. A few companies I applied to had already closed the position weeks ago.", "is_featured": False},
    {"rating": 5, "text": "CareerSphere matched me with a startup I never heard of. Three interviews later, I had an offer 40% above my previous salary. Life changing.", "is_featured": True},

    {"rating": 5, "text": "The coding assessment rounds are well-designed. Much better than the random HackerRank tests other platforms force on you.", "is_featured": True},
    {"rating": 4, "text": "Clean interface with zero clutter. I can actually focus on finding roles instead of being bombarded with irrelevant ads and spam.", "is_featured": False},
